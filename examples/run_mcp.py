"""MCP Multi-Agent System Example

This example demonstrates how to use MCP (Model Context Protocol) with CAMEL agents
for advanced information retrieval and processing tasks.

Environment Setup:
1. Configure the required dependencies of owl library
   Refer to: https://github.com/camel-ai/owl for installation guide

2. MCP Server Setup:


   2.1 MCP Playwright Service:
   ```bash
   # Install MCP service
   npm install -g @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server
   npx playwright install-deps

   # Configure in mcp_servers_config.json:
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "playwright": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   2.2 MCP Fetch Service (Optional - for better retrieval):
   ```bash
   # Install MCP service
   pip install mcp-server-fetch

   # Configure in mcp_servers_config.json:
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "fetch": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": ["-m", "mcp_server_fetch"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

Usage:
1. Ensure all MCP servers are properly configured in mcp_servers_config.json
2. Run this script to create a multi-agent system that can:
   - Access and manipulate files through MCP Desktop Commander
   - Perform web automation tasks using Playwright
   - Process and generate information using GPT-4o
   - Fetch web content (if fetch service is configured)
3. The system will execute the specified task while maintaining security through
   controlled access

Note:
- All file operations are restricted to configured directories
- System uses GPT-4o for both user and assistant roles
- Supports asynchronous operations for efficient processing
