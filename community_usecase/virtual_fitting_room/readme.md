# Virtual Fitting Room
## What's this?

This code example can automatically search for suitable trending products from your designated websites (e.g. Uniqlo) and show you realistic try-on effects with different virtual models (you can also use your own photo as the model to get a more intuitive try-on experience).

All with one prompt ðŸª„

## How to use: 
 1. copy "run_gpt4o.py" to owl/examples
